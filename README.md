# Cat_Fight
This is a simple game I made to practice some Python Object Oriented Programming and Pygame! 

# Gameplay
Use WASD to aim your roll of yarn, and press space to fire. Continue to use WASD to navigate the ball to take out that evil terrier.

# Required Files
Requires Pygame installed to run.
